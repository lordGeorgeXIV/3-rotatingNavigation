        <p> 
            Satoru Gojo was born on December 7, 1989. He was the first person in approximately four hundred years 
            to inherit both the Limitless inherited technique and the Six Eyes. After he was born, the balance 
            of power shifted and Satoru had a bounty worth over a hundred million put on his head and was targeted 
            by bounty hunters, however they were ultimately powerless before him.

            <h3>Satoru Gojo</h3>

            <p>
             At one point, Toji Zenin of the Zenin clan went to see Satoru. While tailing the child, Satoru noticed 
            Toji's presence and turned around to look at him, surprising Toji. This marked the first and last time 
            anyone was aware of Toji's presence while he was standing behind them, as Toji possessed zero cursed energy 
            due to his Heavenly Restriction.
